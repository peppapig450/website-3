# Flower Website Thing for Kat

Cutesie Website for Kat!

## Ideas

- decorate outside with flowers
  - create full around flower border rotating between her favorite flowers -> have them rotate back and forth
  - favorite flowers are orchids, delphiniums and tulips (queen of the night tulips)
- message in heart shaped speech bubble from hello kitty
- flower bouqet in middle with hello kitty
- use a qr code to share the website
- maybe add little rotating flowers or hearts throughout

### Idea's I probably Cant Implement

- Have hello kitty holding a flower bouqet
- flower on her bow
- ~~svg image instead of raw css ?~~ using webp instead of svg or css (flowers too complex for svg)

#### Heart bubble

- animated border with color scheme

## Todo
- [ ]  Get Webp images of the flowers
  - [ ]  Queen of the Night Tulip
  - [ ]  Delphinium (pink)
  - [ ]  Orchids
